<p align="justify"><i><strong>Abstract- </strong> Wet snow shedding from overhead power transmission cables due to periodically repeated impacts was simulated using the finite element software ADINA. It was simulated by point loads whose mass depended on the snow load on the cable. The adhesion between snow and cable was modeled by vertical springs whose stiffness was determined so that the spring force simulates tensile adhesion. Failure criterion for snow detachment from the cable was defined based on the acceleration of the snow-covered cable. This model was applied on a real scale cable with span length of 470 m. Time history of displacement at the excitation point was the input to the model, where varying impacts lead to different accelerations of the cable. The results showed the effects of increasing impact loads on cable jump and, consequently, on the rate of shedding.</i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2> 



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The interest of numerical modeling of the effects of
snow shedding phenomena is to assess the possible dynamic impacts on
transmission line elements, and to check whether the amplitude of the induced
motion is within design limits of clearances between the conductor and the
ground or other conductors. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The
first attempts to estimate rebound heights of conductors due to sudden ice
release were made decades ago (Morgan, and Swift, 1964, Kalman et al., 2007).
Matsuura (Matsuura et al., 1995) carried out real scale observations and analyses
of ice shedding, which are fully exposed to heavy atmospheric icing (6kg/m).
They measured the meteorological conditions, weight of ice, and the tension of
insulator strings. Also, they monitored the motion of conductors. Matsuura et
al. performed the dynamic effects of sudden ice shedding by the finite element
method using ADINA. It can be noticed that a detailed description of their
numerical model is lacking, but they concluded that the numerical and
experimental results of the maximum cable jump were in agreement. Thus, the
numerical analysis of the ice shedding phenomena by the finite element
method(using ADINA) could be useful for the design of transmission lines prone
to severe atmospheric icing.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">More
recently, the improvement of computer software has led to the finite element
modeling of both static and dynamic effects of instantaneous ice shedding on
overhead lines (Kalman et al., 2007, Matsuura et al., 1995, Roshan and McClure,
1998, Jamaleddine et al.,1993). Jamaleddine et al. studied the effect of ice
shedding on overhead lines using Automatic Dynamic Incremental Nonlinear
Analysis (ADINA, 2004), a commercial software package. In their study,
reduced-scale ice shedding simulations were also carried out experimentally by
the sudden drop of dead weights. A comparison between the experimental and
numerical model results confirmed the good performance of the numerical models
for both static and transient dynamic analyses. Jamleddine(1993) and Roshan
Fekr ( 1995) explored many ice-shedding scenarios on single and multiple spans
of overhead cables, with different parameters including ice thickness, span
length, partial ice shedding, and difference in support elevation. These
scenarios were 2-D simplifications of actual overhead lines, and they did not
consider the flexibility of the support towers. The models consisted of cable
spinned at the ends, and hinged suspension strings. The general modeling
approach has been summarized in McClure and Lapointe (McClure, and Lapointe,
2003) explaining the transient response following a cable rupture and it is
applicable to the shedding of ice and snow. Following Jamaleddine work, Roshan
Fekr (1995, 1998) studied a two-span line section response to instantaneous
shedding. He considered several ice-shedding scenarios with variables like ice
thickness, span length, difference in elevation between extremes and suspension
points, number of spans per line section, presence of unequal spans, and
partial ice shedding on sub-spans.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Kalman's
study (Kalman et al., 2005, 2007) is an advanced application to ice shedding.
He studied the application of a mechanical shock on the cable, which created a
propagating wave causing ice rupture. Ice deposits are modeled as a beam finite
element connected in parallel to cable elements using ADINA. Ice beam elements
are prone to failure criteria based on axial and bending stresses. When the
stresses exceed this failure criterion, the ice elements are removed from the
model (element death upon rupture). This model was a powerful tool to estimate
the amount of ice that can be shed following the application of a shock load. Roberge
(2006) simulated the dynamic effects following snow shedding from a cable. He
proposed a finite element model(ADINA) for snow using non-linear spring
elements with zero stiffness and damping properties. Snow elements with mass
are modeled as vertical loads acting on the nodes. The propagation of snow
shedding is modeled by removing mass of adjacent elements at time intervals
corresponding to the speed of shedding (Roberge, 2006, Roberge et al., 2007).
Roberge recommended that, considering the very low cohesive forces of wet snow
sleeves at the instant prior to natural shedding. Failure criteria should be
added to the model based on an upward acceleration not on mechanical stresses
(Roberge, 2006, Roberge et al., 2007). He concluded that the effects of partial
shedding are proportional to the amount of snow removed; mid-span displacement
and cable tension amplitudes were doubled when snow shedding percentage was
doubled. It was found that snow does not shed suddenly from the cable: it will
either shed completely by unzipping manner or partially. Roberge performed
simulations on a 470-m ground wire model and he observed two speeds to evaluate
the effects of snow shedding: 111 m/s, the speed at which total unzipping may
progress; and 14m/s, the speed at which partial natural shedding observed. He
performed his tests in a cold room on 2.5m cable section (Roberge, 2006,
Roberge et al., 2007).</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The
response of the ground wire was evaluated by assuming that a transverse wave
can trigger shedding, as it progresses along the whole span. Snow unzipping is
simulated by removing the snow elements from the model at the rate of 111 m/s.
Regarding cable tension, the cable became slack during the first rebound, then,
once the cable was totally unloaded, the tension oscillated between 4 kN and 20
kN (Roberge, 2006, Roberge et al., 2007). Roberge (Roberge, 2006) has mentioned
that during the experiments, wet snow on a short cable was observed to shed
naturally at speeds up to 14 m/s. This speed was used to evaluate the response
of three partial shedding scenarios. There were no recorded field observations
on the length of partial snow shedding: it was just generally described as
being anywhere from few meters to ten meters (Roberge, 2006). Olqma (Olqma,
2009) and Fonyo (Fonyo, 2008) studied the thermodynamics of snow shedding, and
observed the shedding mechanism from a cable with negligible and significant
sag, respectively. Olqma (Olqma, 2009) observed that shedding began at the ends
of a snow sleeve using negligible sag. He developed a two-dimensional
thermodynamic model that considered the effects of electric current, wind
speed, air temperature and solar radiation on snow shedding. Fonyo (Fonyo,
2008) observed experimentally that for sagged cables, shedding started at the
end of the short sleeve, whereas it started at mid-span for the  long sleeve.
In addition, Zhang (Zhang, 2009) proposed a model in which he investigated the
characteristics of forced convection from a snow sleeve in a cross flow of air.
He found that snow roughness has a significant effect on heat transfer rate,
while, the sleeve shape effect on snow shedding is negligible.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The dynamic behavior of conductors when ice
accumulations are shed both partially and fully, and both uniformly and
unevenly, had been investigated both by tests on actual full-size transmission
lines with lumped loads to simulate accumulated ice and by computation using a multiple-degrees-of-freedom
dynamic model. The influence of ice thickness, the percentage of
ice-shedding, the location of the ice-shedding on the conductor, and the effect
of employing single, double and triple spans in the tests was studied by both
program and physical testing. Good agreement between the numerical computation
and test results was obtained (Meng et al., 2011). The damping
parameter for UHV overhead transmission lines was obtained by comparison of the
results of simulated ice-shedding tests (by releasing weights) on actual
transmission lines, with the results for the equivalent numerical computations.
This damping parameter was then included in several numerical computations of
the effect of ice-shedding on UHV overhead transmission lines for a variety of
conditions (Meng et al., 2012). Field
experiences in some particular areas of Slovenia had shown that during periods
of snowfall overhead lines are randomly exposed to short-circuit events between
conductors that lie in a vertical disposition. Two practical approaches to
reducing the probability of these inter-span contacts that result from the snow
shedding. Both approaches refer to the same overhead line. The first
overhead-line circuit is equipped with phase spacers; the second one is equipped
with V strings (Zemljaric, 2011). </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The
aims of the present study were undertaken to predict the snow shedding effects
due to dynamic loads  on real-scale over-headlines. The effects of excitation
frequency on the snow shedding process were studied using numerical software
(ADINA) including the acceleration, cable jump, cable tension, and rate of
shedding, by considering the adhesion properties.</p>

<h2>2. Mathematical Model</h2>
<h4>2. 1. Snow Model and Failure Criterion for Adhesion</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A
detailed study was performed to observe the possibility of including a failure
criterion for adhesion in the finite element model, satisfying the following
condition: </p>

<div align=center>


<table class=MsoTableGrid border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%"
 style='width:100.0%;border-collapse:collapse;border:none'>
 <tr>
  <td width="100%" style='width:91.46%;padding:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt'>
  <p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt;'><i>Snow mass*acceleration of the
corresponding element &#8805; Adhesive force</i></span></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>


</div>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">When
this failure criterion is fulfilled at any integration point, the element
simulating the corresponding snow chunk is assumed to be fully detached from
the snow/cable interface.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The adhesive force is simulated in the finite element
model by using lumped elements (spring elements) where stiffness is determined
so that the spring force represents the adhesive force, and the snow mass is
simulated by using point loads, i.e. spring elements with mass only as shown in
Fig. 1. It should be noted that in reality, snow deposits can remain attached
to the cable after the adhesion force diminishes as long as the cohesion force
keeps the snow sleeve together. However, this phenomenon was not considered in
the present model.</p>

and point load springs.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Liquid water content (LWC) is an essential parameter
to determine adhesion of wet snow. For low LWC values, below 5-10%, snow does
not stick to objects. When it is in a middle range, between 20-30%, snow firmly
adheres onto the cable. At higher values of LWC (higher than 35%), water is
present in continuous paths and snow grains are completely surrounded by water,
so that adhesion force is close to zero. Adhesion force was determined to be
around 8.7 N for middle range values of LWC (Hefny et al., 2009). Snow
stiffness is very high, since the force causes small displacement of the order
of 0.0001. Once the snow tensile force exceeds the adhesion force limit, the
stiffness of the corresponding element is reduced to zero as shown in Fig. 2,
which means that the element is dead during the rest of analysis; thus, the
snow is detached from the cable.</p>

<h4>2.2. Cable Modeling </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The cable is assumed to be perfectly flexible in
bending and torsion, so that it can be represented by 3-D two-node
isoparametric truss elements using the total Lagrangian formulation with large
displacement kinematics but small strains (Bathe 1996). The cable material
properties are linear elastic tension-only, therefore allowing slackening
whenever the cable loses its pre-stressing force. The initial strain of the
truss elements is specified from a preliminary static analysis assuming a
catenary profile under its self-weight, and adding concentrated loads, which
simulate snow load. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The Young's modulus of cable is 112 GPa In the models
presented here, meshes with 0.25m long cable elements were found to be precise
enough, the initial sag to span is chosen to be 2.5%. The cable stress strain
curve simulates the taut cable with high stiffness is found more precise giving
accurate results. The two ends of the cable were considered as fixed during the
static analysis, whereas, the vertical displacement of the left support was
prescribed during the dynamic analysis according to the excitation. The nodes
in between were supposed as free  moving in the  vertical plane in the static
and dynamic analyses. In addition the x,y,z axes corresponds to transverse,
longitudinal, and vertical axes respectively.</p>


<h4>2.3. Cable Damping</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The aerodynamic damping which arises from the motion
of the cable relative to the air is neglected. Internal damping is considered,
which is a combination of damping within the individual cable strands and the
sliding friction between the strands, also it occurs due to changes tension and
transverse damping due to bending of cable. Numerical damping is used to filter
out spurious high frequencies from the response due to finite element
discretization. Damping is modeled by using non-linear axial spring elements
defining viscous discrete dashpots parallel to each cable element. The damping
constant is determined from the critical axial viscous damping of a Hookean rod
given by Eq. 1 (Lapointe 2003), where <i>C ( Nkg/m) </i>is the damping
constant, <img
width=16 height=21 id="Picture 5" src="013_t_files/image003.png"> is the
damping ratio,  <i>AE </i>is the axial rigidity of the rod, and <i>m </i>is its
mass per unit length. The damping constant is set to represent an equivalent
viscous damping of 2% critical for ice (Yu, 1952). In the present study it is
set to represent 2% damping for snow. </p>

<H4>2.4 Static and Dynamic Analysis</H4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In order to avoid the stiffening effect of the
flexural rigidity of the snow element on the initial static profile, the
deformed cable profile is calculated beforehand using concentrated loads which
simulate snow load. The deflected static profile serves as the initial profile
of the snow-cable composite model where the cable element is initially
prestressed by setting the initial strain to the value obtained from static
analysis of the catenary cable model with concentrated loads. This procedure
decrease the level of initial stress in iced beam elements preventing their
spurious shedding.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Static analysis was completed in one load increment,
so that dynamic implicit analysis was usually started at time <i>t = 1 s.</i> 
The load acts at the excited end point, where the displacement of the node is
prescribed in the vertical direction, whereas the horizontal movement is
neglected. In order to investigate the effects of periodic-load characteristics
on the dynamic response, the load was defined by different periodic functions.
The time step and the mesh size were chosen so as to provide adequate sampling
of the wave, as it travels through the cable finite element mesh .             </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The Bathe composite integration method with parameter
0.5 is found to be the best choice to obtain more accurate and reliable
results, specially with this specific load type and small time step.
Concerning, Newmark integration operator, which is generally used in previous
studies (Roberge,  2006, Kalman, 2007). For
the calculation of all element matrices and vectors, numerical Gauss
integration is used. The convergence criterion is based on the energy
tolerance; ETOL, and displacement tolerances; DTOL, with values ETOL = 1.0 <sup>7</sup>
and DTOL = 1.0<sup>5</sup>. A lumped mass formulation is used throughout(Bathe,
1996).  In Previous studies, the deformed cable profile is calculated
beforehand using an increased density cable model as in previous studies
(Jameleddine et al., 1993, McClure and Tinawi, 1987, Roshan Fekr and McClure,
1988, Roshan Fekr, 1995, Peabody, 2004, Lapointe, 2003, McClure and Lapointe,
2003).</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In the experimental setup the cable and the centers of
the attachment points at the end of the span are aligned so that the cable is
in the same plane along its entire length. Furthermore, the shock loading
piston setup at the mid span is also aligned in the cable plane. Therefore, the
numerical model (ADINA) is also represented in the same 2-D plane. </p>

<h2>3.
Results and Discussion</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The
time function of periodic load serves as input to the numerical model, defined
by its displacement time history. The shape of the displacement function was
the same in each simulation as shown in Fig. 3. When the period of excitation
decreased, the length of time steps, d<i>t</i>, was
changed correspondingly, but the number of time steps in one cycle was kept
constant. Thus, shorter time steps resulted in faster drop of the excitation
point and greater acceleration at the impact. The period was varied from 0.586

<h4>3.1
Application for Real Scale Span</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The numerical model is applied to a level single-span
of an overhead ground wire. The parameters of the line section with a span
length of 470 m are adapted from (Roberge, 2006), which is an attempt to apply
the numerical results for a specific span used by &Eacute;lectricit&eacute; de
France (EDF). However, it should be remarked that this can serve only as an
illustration due to the lack of characterizing period and corresponding
acceleration parameters of the real-scale test. In addition, the available
real-scale experimental results are scarce. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The following cable and snow properties were used in
the model: cable diameter is 0.0126 m, cable area is 9.41e-5 m<sup>2</sup>,
cable density is 5111 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, initial strain is 0.0097, sag is 11.8
m, snow density is 600 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and snow mass is 9.05 kg. The
resultant mass for each spring was around 0.045 kg for 201 springs along the
whole length. The worst shedding scenario according to EDF involved dimension
of 0.042 m radial and 600 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. The amplitude of excitation was
0.11 m, cable damping adopted was 2% (Roberge, 2006), and the snow sleeve was
227 m long.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Using the average adhesion force in the real scale
model will cause complete shedding, thus the adhesion force using experimental
results (Hefny et al., 2009) was chosen to be 8.7 N. Table 1 represents
different time steps, the corresponding period, and the rate of shedding.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In
the case of 0.435 s, snow started shedding from the excited point then
partially along the cable (Fig. 4). The rate of shedding increased by decreasing
the excitation period, since the acceleration peak during the impacts
increased. The rate was 0%, 39%, 73%, and 100% for cases 1, 2, 3, 4
respectively (Table 1). Numerical results indicate that the maximum cable jump
at mid-span obtained for the instantaneous snow shedding simulation (Case 4) is
higher than when propagating snow shedding takes place (Cases 1-3), as shown in
Table1. The impact is not as strong in the case of propagating shedding as the
time needed to achieve full-span unloading can take several seconds whereas
unloading is significantly faster for instantaneous shedding. Snow is detached
by mixed way (unzipping followed by partial) for all cases, where, the transverse wave had sufficient energy to de-ice the
cable until its mid span. From  there, it was capable of causing only partial
snow shedding. Snow shedding generates a transverse wave in the ground wire, that
propagates along the span. This transverse wave propagation causes significant
bending of the snow deposit on the wire at high deformation speed and can break
up the snow. In each snow cable composite element when the failure criterion of
the snow in terms of  adhesion stress is fulfilled at any integration point,
the snow element and its mass and stiffness contributions are removed from the
model, i.e. effective snow-shedding is assumed to take place.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The
cable jump (distance between maximum and minimum) in the middle was around 0.5
m for a 73% shedding. The jump was rather small because the snow load is tiny
comparing to the cable span. Concerning the amplitude, it was observed to
increase after 4 s, since the rate of shedding increased from 16% to 73% after
that period (Fig. 5).</p>

Figure 5. Cable jump time history at the mid-point.</figcaption>

<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">      The acceleration time history at the suspension point contains peaks corresponding
to the drops in the displacement time history, which is followed by some low
oscillations, and then by another peak at the next impact. Concerning the
peaks, they raise up to 825 m/s<sup>2</sup> average. The shape of the signal
includes some high oscillations related to the numerical filtration of the
system (Fig. 6). Comparing to the mid-point acceleration the acceleration peaks
are smaller, with a value about 120 m/s<sup>2</sup> in average. There is a
decrease of about 85% between the suspension point and mid-point of the cable
(cf. Figs. 6 and 7). The
numerically-generated high frequency content of the response was partly
filtered out by the numerical integration operator. However, high spurious peak
oscillations were still present, which correspond to the fundamental
longitudinal (axial) vibration of the snow-cable. Although in practice, such acceleration seem to be large, the author
believes that the maximum peak value is over-predicted by the finite
model(ADINA), but the average peaks seem to be good (Fig.6). One of the ways to
deal with these high amplitude peaks was to eliminate them from the time
history plots. Moreover, implementing smaller time steps in the initial phase
of the response had clear beneficial effects and leads to smoother plots and
less spurious high frequencies.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Concerning the cable tension at the fixed end,
statically it is around 11000 N, but using the periodic load it increases up to
an average of 84800 N. The signal includes higher oscillations because the
flexibility of the fixed support is not considered in the model (Fig. 8). Concerning the tension results, the sensitivity of
the numerical model to the flexibility of the cable end supports was not
considered in the numerical model at this stage of analysis, and also there is
a simplifying assumption in modeling the tensional rigidity of the cable, may
be these two aspects affect the tension results by some percentage of error. </p>

<h2>4.
Conclusion</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">        
In this study, a model is proposed to simulate snow shedding induced by a
periodic load on a single-span overhead cable, where the mass of snow deposited
and its adhesion to the cable are considered. This finite element model using
ADINA can serve as a means to study various failure criteria for wet snow in
terms of adhesion and cohesion. The numerical model takes into account the
adhesive strength of snow deposit and its dependence on LWC, which is important
for both reduced-scale and real lines as well.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> Simulation results indicate that the acceleration
peaks of the periodic load, which is capable of removing the accreted snow from
the cable, is an important design issue. The larger the excitation period or
the smaller the acceleration peak, the less snow sheds.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> It should be stated that while the transverse wave
traveled along the span, snow accumulated on the cable broke up into very small
fragments, and shed without any cracks. This snow-breaking action and shedding
absorbed energy from the traveling wave but the wave continued the same with no
damping, i.e. the wave did not die out.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> The modeling approach accurately estimated the
effective snow shedding rate. For the numerical models to be more accurate in
predicting snow shedding, it was necessary to consider the adhesive strength of
the fractured snow deposits that remain attached to the cable after the
transient effects of the response were dissipated. Although, there were some
small overestimation because the model did not consider the cohesion attraction
between snow particles.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> Numerical studies had shown that it was feasible to
implement the new snow failure criterion based on maximum adhesion to
single-span real scale overhead lines. Furthermore, an optimum mesh size of a
real scale snow conductor was found which will significantly reduce the
computational efforts in a complex transmission line model with snow
conductors.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> Damping simulated by spring elements performed better
than other type damping, which underestimates the ratio of shedding.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In
future work, it is recommended to apply the proposed model for different
conductors and ground wires in two span lines, a further possible improvement
of the model is to extend it into 3D and to consider the effects of towers and
other interfaces. also it is recommended to study the effect of cohesion forces
on snow shedding  jointly with adhesion using horizontal springs (with
stiffness only). In addition this model can be applied to multiple spans like
three or more.</p>
