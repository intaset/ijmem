    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>A detailed evaluation of the performance parameters in the laminar flow regime with regard to the enhancement of heat transfer using winglet type vortex generators has been accomplished in this study. Three dimensional numerical studies of flow structure and laminar convectionheat transfer are performed in a plate fin heat exchanger with longitudinal vortex generators (LVGs) in present paper. The Effects of common ﬂow up and common ﬂow down pairs of vortices produced by LVGs with two different shapes of the winglets, a pair of rectangular winglet (RWP) and a pair of delta winglet (DWP), are studied at various Reynolds numbers. The results show that effect of LVGs could effectively enhance the heat transfer of the heat exchanger. According to the non-dimensional defined parameter for evaluation of performance, (N<sub>um</sub>/N<sub>um,0</sub>)/(f/f<sub>0</sub>), the channel with DWP shows better overall performance than RWP. The common ﬂow down configuration of DWP shows a better overall performance at Reynolds numbers lower than 720 and common ﬂow up conﬁguration of DWP shows a better overall performance at Reynolds numbers more than 720; also, the common ﬂow down conﬁguration shows a better overall performance than the common ﬂow up conﬁguration for RWP.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4> 


<p class="body">The compact heat
exchangers are widely employed in heating, warming and cooling applications in
such fields as automobile industries, chemical engineering, power system,
aerospace, air conditioning, and electronic chip cooling, etc.</p>

<p class="body">The subject of heat
transfer enhancement have attracted many researchers for a long time to develop
more compact and low cost heat exchangers with high efficiency and the weight
as light as possible. It is well known that the thermal resistance of gas is
generally much higher than the other contributions. Hence, Efforts to improve
refrigerant to air heat exchanger performance should focus on reducing the dominant
thermal resistance on the air side of the heat exchanger. </p>

<p class="body">Different methods are
used for heat transfer augmentation in thermal systems. Active (require
external power) and passive (no need to external power) methods are two groups
for this goal (Webb, 1994 and Jacobi and Shah, 1995). In the two past decades,
considerable researches have been focused on impact of the passive generation
of longitudinal vortices on the heat transfer enhancement. Due to pressure
difference between two sides of vortex generator, the flow along the side edges
separates and generates vortices. Transverse, longitudinal and horseshoe
vortices can generate by vortex generators. As described by Fiebig (1995), when
angel of attack of VGs is small, generates vortices are mainly longitudinal,
and when VGs are perpendicular to the flow direction, generates vortices are
mainly transverse. When longitudinal vortex generators (LVGs) used near a heat
transfer surface, generated vortices due to presence of LVGs distorted the
temperature field in the channel and they increase the heat transfer between
the fluid and its neighbouring surfaces by transporting fluid from the wall
into the free stream and vice versa.</p>

<p class="body">The first report on
boundary layer control to delay boundary layer separation on aircraft wings by
using longitudinal vortices was presented in 1960 by Schubauer and Spangenberg (1960).
The influence of vortex generators on the heat transfer performance was studied
by Jonhnson and Joubert (1969). Since then, considerable researches focused on
the use of LVGs to enhance heat transfer performance.</p>

<p class="body">Delta and cube winglet
are studied by Edwards and Alker (1974) and they showed better overall
performance of delta winglets. On the other hand Local distribution of heat
transfer is studied by Katoaka et al. (1977). Velocity and temperature
distributions are studied and reported by Fiebig et al. (1989). Fiebig et al.
(1991) showed that local heat transfer with winglet could be three times larger
than channel flow without winglet in laminar regime. In another experimental
research Fiebig et al. studied various types of wing and winglets. </p>

<p class="body">Zhu et al. (1995)
numerically investigated the heat transfer and turbulent flow in a
rectangular channel with rectangular winglets on one wall and rib-roughness
elements on the other wall. Results showed that the combined effect of
rib-roughness and vortex generators could increase the average Nusselt number
about 450%.</p>

<p class="body">Deb et al. (1995)
numerically studied heat transfer and flow structure in laminar and
turbulent flows in a rectangular channel with built-in delta winglets. Biswas
et al. (1996) carried out numerical and experimental studies of flow structure
and heat transfer effects of longitudinal vortices behind a delta winglet
placed in a laminar channel flow. They observed that Presence of delta
winglet will cause produce a main vortex, a corner vortex and an induced vortex.
Also, they define a parameter for evaluation of performance quality which
indicates heat transfer augmentation for a given pressure loss penalty.</p>

<p class="body">Lee et al. (1999)
numerically studied heat transfer characteristics and structure of turbulence
in a three-dimensional turbulent boundary layer with delta wing LVGs. They
found that longitudinal vortices are capable of disturbing the turbulent and
thermal boundary layer, which caused anisotropy of turbulent intensity and the
best heat transfer enhancement in the region where the flows are directed
toward the wall but the vortex core is the region of relatively lower mixing.</p>

<p class="body">Lau et al. (1999)
measured temperature and instantaneous velocity vector of the turbulent channel
flow with embedded longitudinal vortices using quadruple hot-wire probes.
Fluid Flow and heat transfer behind a vortex generators studied by Henze and
Wolfersdorf (2011) experimentally at Reynolds number of 300000.</p>

<p class="body">Liou et al. (2000)
carried out experimental investigation on twelve different shaped vortex
generators to study the heat transfer enhancement in a sharp turning two-pass
square duct. They showed the importance of secondary flow characteristics and
their effects on heat transfer.</p>

<p class="body">Yang et al. (2001)
numerically studied the effects of different attack angles of the delta winglet
pair on flow field and heat transfer created by interactions between a pair of
vortices generated by a vortex generator in a rectangular channel turbulent
flow. Gentry and Jacobi (1997, 2002) experimentally explored the heat transfer
enhancement in flat-plate flow and developing channel flows with built-in
delta wings by a naphthalene sublimation technique. The results indicated that
the average heat transfer could be increased by 50-60% at low Reynolds number
conditions in comparison with the same channel flow with no delta-wing vortex
generator.</p>

<p class="body">Sohankar and Davidson
(2003) carried out unsteady three-dimensional DNS and LES simulations to
investigate the flow and heat structures in a plate-fin heat exchanger with
vortex generators. The thickness of the winglet is ignored in this study.</p>

<p class="body">In a numerical study
two types of winglets are compared by Ferrouillatet al. (2006). This study
showed that the delta vortex generators were better than the rectangular vortex
generators pair in terms of heat transfer and mixing.</p>

<p class="body">Sohankar (2007)
simulated three-dimensional unsteady flow and heat transfer using Direct
Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for a channel with
two angled finite thickness ribs as a vee-shaped vortex generator to augment
heat transfer.</p>

<p class="body">Hiravennavar et al.
(2007) performed a numerical simulation to investigate the unsteady,
laminar,three-dimensionalflow structure and heat-transfer enhancement by a
delta winglet pair at various Reynolds numbers and winglet thicknesses.</p>

<p class="body">Yang et al. (2008)
studied the effects of winglet with common flow up configuration on heat
transfer and flow in turbulent regime.</p>

<p class="body">A modified rectangular
longitudinal vortex generator (LVG) is presented and studied by Min et al. (2010).
This modified wing performs better than original wing.</p>

<p class="body">Winglets are also used
in micro channels in order to improve heat transfer for liquid flow by Liu et
al. (2011). They found that the range of critical Reynolds numbers  were at a
much smaller value by adding winglets than the one without; heat transfer
performance was improved (9-21% higher for those with laminar flow and 39-90%
for those with turbulent flow).</p>

<p class="body">Winglet various attack
angles are experimentally and numerically studied by Wu and Tao (2012). The
results showed that the average Nusselt number on the surfaces of plate
increases with the increase of the attack angle.</p>

<p class="body">He et al. (2012) numerically
studied the potential of punched winglet type vortex generator arrays to
augment heat transfer performance of finned tube heat exchanger.  They
reported 34-81% enhancement in heat transfer coefficient accompanied by 43-136%
pressure drop penalty.</p>

<p class="body">Heat
transfer augmentation of a plate-fin heat exchanger equipped with two rows of
winglet type vortex generators with five different strategic placements of the
VG numerically investigated by Sinha et al. (2013). The Reynolds number which
they studied was varied in the range of 250–1580.</p>

<p class="body">Effects of the
different winglets shapes and configurations on the heat transfer augmentation
at various Reynolds numbers are presented in this paper. </p>

<h4>2. Model Descriptions</h4>
<p class="subhead">2. 1. Geometric
Configurations</p>

<p class="body">Simulations are
performed on a three-dimensional flat plate channel which is equipped by two
neighbouring fins. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the channel
with LVGs used for simulations in which X, Y, Z are stream wise, normal, and
span wise coordinates, respectively. The model adopted in this study includes a
pair of winglets with a chord length (l) equal to channel height (H), the
length of the channel (L) equals 25H, the aspect ratio of the channel (AR=W/H)
equals 4.0, the height of the winglets (h) equals 0.5H. The distance between
the trailing edge of the winglet and the entry of the channel(s) equals 2.707
H. The winglets are positioned such that the minimum transverse distance
between the winglet pair (a) equals 0.5H. The angle of attack of the winglets is
45°. The winglet width equals 0.01H. The effects of two different shapes of
winglet including delta winglet pair and rectangular winglet pair investigated
in the present study.</p>

<p class="body">Two different
configurations of the LVGs attached on the bottom of the channel are
considered in this study (Figure1). Due to symmetric arrangement, the
computations are done in the shadow region in Figure 1.</p>

<p class="subhead">2. 2. Governing
Equations and Boundary Conditions</p>

<p class="body">In
this investigation, air is used as working fluid. The generation of
longitudinal vortices is a quasi-steady phenomenon (S. Ferrouillat,
2006). Due to the low air velocity and the small
fin pitch, the flow in the channel of heat
exchanger is laminar. The flow and heat transfer
computations are performed for a three-dimensional, steady and incompressible
flow of air with constant physical properties.&nbsp;The
governing equations for the fluid flow including continuity, momentum
and energy equationsin non-dimensional form and standard
tensor notation can be expressed as follows.</p>

<h4>3. Numerical Methods</h4>

<p class="body">The
computational domain is discretized by non-uniform grids, in which the grids in
channel region and near the walls are fine enough. In order to improve
the accuracy of the simulation results, the grids around the winglets and the
channel walls are refined.</p>

<p class="body">Second
order upwind scheme is used to discretize the convective terms of the governing
equations for momentum and energy and central difference scheme is employed for
the diffusion terms. SIMPLEC algorithm has been used in order to implement the
coupling between pressure and velocity. The convergence criterion is that the
scaled residuals of momentum and continuity equations are all less than 1.0×10<sup>&#8722;</sup><sup>6</sup> and the scaled residual of energy equation
is less than 1.0×10<sup>&#8722;7</sup>. The described model with the introduced
boundary conditions are solved using OpenFOAM solver(Jasak 2006). </p>


<p class="subhead">3. 1. Numerical
Simulations and Validation of Model</p>

<p class="body">Before
reporting any computational results the grid independence test and model
verification must be performed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
numerical simulations. In order to validate the independency of solution on the
grids, a flat plate channel which is equipped by DWP
in common flow up configuration is considered at Reynolds number
equals to 750. Four different grid systems are studied which include about
35,000, 65,000, 155,000 and 250,000 cells. The results are presented in table
2. In cases with grid points numbers below 155,000 Nu<sub>m</sub> is affected
by grid point's number. The average Nusselt number of the fourth grid system
differs from that of the third by less than 0.12%. Hence, for present study, in
order to decrease the computation time and cost the final grid number is
selected as about 155,000.</p>

<p class="body">In addition to grid independence validation, the characteristics of
heat transfer and fluid flow are compared with the available experimental and
numerical results published in literature. Thus, numerical simulations are
performed for a flat plate and plate which is equipped with a pair of delta
winglet in common flow up configuration where punched directly from the plate
at attack angles of 45°. Geometrical parameters for the tested plates in the
channels which used to verify the model are presented in (Wu and Tao,
2012). The Reynolds number which is presented in experimental
results is based on the channel height and varies from 500 to 2000. The
corresponding air volumetric flow rate in the channel inlet varies from 2.5 liter
to 9.2 liter. The predicted results (Mean Nusselt number, Nu<sub>m</sub>, versus
Reynolds number, Re) are compared with experimental and numerical results from (Wu
and Tao 2012). The variations of the average Nusselt number are presented in
figure 2. The mean deviation between simulated results and experimental values
is less than 6.9% and the maximum deviation is less than 8.8%
in present study. The deviations between experimental and numerical results of
the average Nusselt number are all less than 10% in (Wu and Tao 2012) investigations. The uncertainty in the reported experimental value of the surface
convection heat transfer coefficient in (Wu and Tao 2012) tests is less than 6.28%.</p>

<h4>4. Results</h4>
<p class="subhead">4. 1. Flow Structure</p>

<p class="body">The
four different cases mentioned above are simulated and the results of flow
field are presented in this section. The development of the secondary flow obtained
from the simulations is presented at four different locations along stream wise
direction downstream of the LVGs in figure 3 for Re=750. The plots show the
generation of the counter-rotating vortices by LVGs, their gradual deformation
and decrease in their strength as they move downstream in the channel. The
effect of channel walls on vortical structures can be seen when the cross-flow
at any two stations downstream of the winglets are compared. Two
counter-rotating main vortices behind the winglets cause the fluid to churn.
This churning motion causes the fluid near the wall to flow in the central
region and vice versa.</p>

<p class="body">It
can be seen in figure 3(I and III) that common flow down vortices cause the downwash
flow toward the lower wall which is observable between the vortices, and the
upwash flow away from the lower wall which is observable in the outside region
of the vortices. As common flow down vortices move downstream in the channel,
the distance between axes of main vortices increases. Figure 3(II and IV) shows
that common flow up vortices cause the downwash flow which occurs in the
outside region of the vortices, and the upwash flow occurs in the central
region. Unlike the common flow down, the distance between axes of main vortices
does not change, and the distance of the vortices from the lower wall considerably
increases as vortices move downstream. A comparison of the secondary velocity
vectors between different plots in figure 3 indicates that the strength of
vortices generated by RWP is more than that of DWP.</p>

direction (Re=750).</figcaption>
</figure>



<p class="body">Figure
4 shows the circulation distribution along stream wise direction in the channel
for flat plate and four different cases at Re=750. It is clearly seen in figure
4 that the circulation distribution in flat plate channel flow is less compared
to other different cases which are equipped with VGs. At winglets upstream
region, the variations of the circulation for all flow cases are almost same.
Moreover, the maximum circulation for channels with VGs is located in
downstream of winglets, giving a maximum circulation at about x/H=3 for channel
flows with DWP and at about x/H=3.2 for channel flows with RWP vortex
generators. The circulation distribution for channel flows with DWP is almost
same in two different configurations (Common flow up and common flow down); In
contrast to this, channels with RWP generally do not
show same behavior in different configurations. As mentioned in figure 3,
figure 4 again shows that, in the channels with RWP,
circulation is relatively higher than that of the
channels with DWP. The maximum circulation in winglets downstream can be found
in channels with RWP in the common flow up configuration. Compared with flat
plate channel flow, circulation increased by 47.4% for channels with DWP and
increased by 86% and 91.2% for the channels with RWP in the common
flow down and common flow up configurations, respectively. It
is found that common flow down VGs with a certain minimum
spacing between the vanes provide less decay of circulation, which is due to
the viscous dissipation, than common flow up configurations.</p>

flow direction (Re=750).</figcaption>

<p class="body">Figure
5 shows the variation of the pressure coefficient along the stream wise
direction for flat plate and four different cases of channel at Re=750. It can
be seen that the pressure coefficient of the flat plate channel gradually
decreases along the stream wise direction. In winglets upstream, the variations
of the pressure coefficient are nearly identical for the all cases. The
simulation results indicate a steep decrease in pressure coefficient due to the
resistance of the vortex generators very near the location of winglet pairs
leading edge (x/H=2). This steep decrease continues to x/H=3.2 for channels
with DWP in both configurations and channels with RWP in common flow down
configuration. This steep decrease for channels with RWP in common flow up
configuration continues to x/H=3.0. After this decrease, a rather quickly
increase is observed which is due to the increase of the cross section flow
area. Afterwards, the pressure coefficient gradually decreases in the stream wise
direction. By analysis the above results, it is found that the friction resistance
of the channel walls is the most important factor influencing the air flow resistance
in the flat plate case. Considering figure 5, it can be concluded that in
addition of the friction resistance of the channel walls, flow resistance in
the channels with winglet pairs depends on the local resistance caused by the
presence of VGs. It means in the region that the VG is placed addition pressure
drag is brought about. The pressure drop for channels with RWP is more than
channels equipped by DWP. Pressure coefficient distribution for channels with
DWP is almost same in different configurations while for channels with RWP this
is not so. At the channel outlet the pressure drop for channels with RWP in
common flow up configuration is higher than that for channels with RWP in
common flow down configuration; while, the pressure drop for channels with RWP
in common flow down configuration is more than that for channels with RWP in
common flow up configuration in a short distance downstream of the trailing
edge of the winglet pairs.</p>

<p class="body">Figure
6 shows the influence of Reynolds number on the apparent friction coefficient of
the channel in flat plate and four different cases. This figure indicated that
by increasing the Reynolds number, the apparent friction coefficient increases.
Considering all cases, it is observed that the apparent friction coefficient
for channels with VGs have larger values compared with flat plate channel under
different Reynolds number. Among all cases, channels with RWP have higher apparent
friction coefficient compared with other cases.</p>

<p class="body">Figure
7 shows the increases of the friction factor ratio in the channel with
different configurations versus Reynolds number in order to compare effects of
different configurations. The results indicate that in higher Reynolds number
the difference between friction factor ratios of each configuration with flat
plate increases. For instance, At Reynolds number equals to 200, the friction factor
ratios in the channel with DWP and RWP in common flow up configuration are 8.5%
and 25%, respectively; and at Reynolds number equal to 1000, the friction
factor ratios in the channel with DWP and RWP in common flow up configuration
are 20.1% and 61.2%, respectively. Friction factor ratio of the channels with
RWP is relatively higher than that for the channels with DWP. However,
the difference between the channel with DWP in common flow up and common flow
down configurations is very small. Also, in channels with RWP, common flow up
configuration has higher values than common flow down configuration.</p>

<p class="body">Flow
structure considered in this section by analyzing the results of simulations
such as secondary flows, circulation, pressure drops, and friction factor. The
results indicated that presence of winglets in channels generate to
counter-rotating main vortices behind the winglets. The secondary flow
generated by the winglets has significant influence on the flow field in
channel which can enhance the mixing of the hotter fluid at the walls and
cooler fluid at the middle of the channel. It causes an increase in temperature
gradient at the walls and hence enhancing heat transfer performance. In the
next section heat transfer characteristic of the channels with LVGs are
investigated.</p>

distribution, heat fluxes and Nusselt number are presented in this section.
Figure 8 shows the results of non-dimensional temperature profile at different
cross sections along the channel for four different cases at Re=750. Considering
figure 8(I and III) it is indicates that contours of non-dimensional
temperature are thickened in the upwash region and thinned in the downwash
region. Figure 8(II and IV) shows that there is a little change in temperature
profile. It means that the longitudinal vortices do not have significant
influence on the temperature profile due to maintenance of their distance
from wall when they move to downstream.</p>

<p class="body">Figure
9 shows the variation of the span wise local heat flux, on the lower
channel wall at x/H=5.0for Re=750. On the lower wall the span wise local heat
flux for the channel with winglets in common flow up configuration
is higher than that of the flat plate channel only when z/H&gt;0.3 and
z/H&gt;0.2, respectively. Considering figure 8, in this region the thermal
boundary layer is thickened due to the upwash flow generated by pair of
vortices. In the outer region, the span wise local heat flux is higher
for channels equipped with winglets in common flow up configuration. Also, on
the lower wall the span wise local heat flux for the channel with
winglets in common flow down configuration is lower than that of the
flat plate channel when z/H&gt;1.29 and z/H&gt;1.03, respectively.
Considering figure 8, due to the upwash flow generated by pair of vortices the
thermal boundary layer is thickened in this region.</p>

<p class="body">Figure
10 shows the variation of the span wise local heat flux, on the upper
channel wall at x/H=5.0for Re=750.On the upper wall,
the span wise local heat flux for channels with winglets in common flow
down configuration is lower in the central region (z/H&lt;0.8) and higher
in the outer region compared with the flat plate channel. On the upper
wall the span wise local heat flux for the channel with winglets in
common flow up configuration is higher than that of the flat plate
channel when z/H&lt;6.2 and z/H&lt;0.45, respectively. As mentioned in figure 3,
the distance of the common flow up vortices from the lower wall considerably
increases as vortices move downstream; thus, the increase of the span wise local
heat flux on the upper wall of the channels with winglet in common flow
up configuration is larger than that of common flow down configuration.</p>

<p class="body">The Nusselt
number along the channel is sketched in figure 11. It is found that the Nusselt
number of the channels with LVGs significantly increases compared to the
channels without the vortex generators. It is clearly seen in figure 11 that
the heat transfer enhancement by using LVGs occurs not only in the region where
the LVGs are attached, but also in the long distance downstream. The results
indicate that on average, Nusselt number increased by 15.72-33.37% for channels
equipped with LVGs.</p>

<p class="body">Figure
12 shows the mean Nusselt number for five different cases as a function of
Reynolds number. This figure indicated that by increasing the Reynolds number,
the Nusselt number increases. Considering all cases, it is clearly observed
that Nusselt number for channels with VGs always have larger values compared
with flat plate channel under different Reynolds number. Nusselt number of
common flow down configuration is lower than that of common flow up configuration
for the channel with RWP or DWP. Among all cases, channels with RWP have higher
Nusselt number compared with other cases. For instance, at Reynolds number
equals 300, the Nusslet number is 4.44in the flat plate channel, 4.81, 4.83 in
the channels with DWP in common flow down and common flow up configurations,
Respectively and 5.17, 5.33 in channels with RWP in common flow down and common
flow up configurations, Respectively.</p>

<p class="body">As
far as the heat transfer enhancement is concerned the results should be explain
in comparison with flat plate channel. In order to investigate the heat transfer
performance the Nusselt number ratio ((Nu-Nu<sub>0</sub>)/Nu<sub>0</sub>)
studied at various Reynolds numbers.</p>

<p class="body">The
Nusselt number ratio versus Reynolds number is depicted in figure 13. It can be
clearly observed that Nusselt number ratio increases with increasing Reynolds
number. Compared with the flat-plate channel, the Nusselt number ratio increases
by 10.7-45.6% and 3.8-25.6% for the channels with RWP and DWP in the common
flow up configuration, respectively. Also, Nu/Nu<sub>0</sub>
increases by 8.4-38.4% and 3.3-21% for the channels with RWP and DWP in the
common flow down configuration, respectively. Analysis of the above
results indicates that the VG does have effect to enhance heat transfer. It is
found that channels with RWP in common flow up configuration provides the better
effectiveness of the heat transfer enhancement, the next is the RWP in common
flow down configuration and then DWP in common flow up configuration and DWP in
common flow down configuration in order.</p>

<p class="body">As
mentioned in previous parts, heat transfer enhancement that occurs by using
LVGs is associated with increase of pressure drop. A performance evaluation
parameter, (Nu<sub>m</sub>/Nu<sub>m,0</sub>)/(f/f<sub>0</sub>), is defined as a
measure of the amount of the heat transfer enhancement against the pressure
drop increase in order to investigate the overall performance of the channels
with different shaped winglets and different configurations. The better
the overall performance of the channel, the larger the value of (Nu<sub>m</sub>/Nu<sub>m,0</sub>)/(f/f<sub>0</sub>).
The overall performance of four different cases in comparison with flat plate
channel is presented at various Reynolds numbers in figure 14. It is found
that, however the heat transfer enhancement in channels with RWP is more than
channels with DWP, the overall performance of the channels with DWP is better
than channels with RWP. In channels with DWP the overall performance increases by
increasing Reynolds number. The difference between two different configurations
of DWP is small and when the Reynolds number is more than 500 the overall
performance of the channel which is equipped by DWP is more than one. Overall
performance of the channels with RWP is less than one. Channels with RWP in
common flow down configuration have better overall performance than common flow
up configuration.</p>

<h4>5. Conclusion</h4>

<p class="body">The aim of the present
study is to investigate the effects of LVGs on the flow structure and heat
transfer in a plate fin heat exchanger using winglet type vortex generators. A
numerical simulation of laminar flow over two different shaped LVGs of RWP and DWP
with two different configurations of common flow up and common
flow down in a rectangular channel has been performed at various Reynolds
numbers. </p>

<p class="body">The
following conclusions are made regarding the results of the flow structure and
the heat transfer characteristics obtained from simulations.</p>

<p class="body">The
longitudinal vortex generators significantly increase the circulation in the
channel flow. The generated vortices by winglets changed the velocity and
temperature distributions in channels. The magnitude of the velocity vector of
the secondary flow and the strength of the primary vortices decrease as the
vortices develop in downstream region of the winglets, and the shape of primary
vortices are maintained over a long distance in downstream. Also, channel walls
influence on vortical structures.</p>

<p class="body">The
use of longitudinal vortex generators increases the pressure drop in channel
flow. The pressure drop for channels with RWP is more than channels equipped by
DWP and the pressure drop of the channel with common flow down
configuration is smaller than that of common flow up
configuration. The results of simulation indicate that by increasing the
Reynolds number, the friction factor decreases; while, in higher Reynolds
number the friction factor ratios of each configuration is more than flat
plate.</p>

<p class="body">The
longitudinal vortices improve the convective heat transfer not only in the
region near LVGs but also in the large region downstream. So the LVs have
ability to enhance the global heat transfer of channel.</p>

<p class="body">The
performance of the heat exchangers can obviously enhance by mounting vortex
generators on the surfaces of gas side. Vortex generators cause an augmentation
in heat transfer of the channel. For the channel with RWP the mean Nusselt
number is increased by 8.4-45.7% and for the channel with DWP is increased by
3.3-25.7% in the whole range of Reynolds number of the present study. Nusselt
number of common flow down configuration is lower than that of common flow up configuration
for the channel with RWP or DWP.</p>

<p class="body">The
overall performance of the channels equipped by DWP is better than channels
with RWP. The difference between different configurations for channels with DWP
is very slight. Overall performance of common flow down configuration is better
than common flow up configuration for channels with RWP.</p>
