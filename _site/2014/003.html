<p align="justify"><i><strong>Abstract- </strong> In this paper the wall jet, and the problem of jet in counter-flow are introduced briefly and an experimental method for finding the velocity field of a round wall jet in counter-flow is presented. The jet to counter-flow velocity ratio is changed from 1.3 to 25. The measuring technique is two component particle image velocimetry (PIV) by using 4 cameras which provides a large field of view to cover the whole penetration depth of the wall jet at all conditions. The details of the experimental procedure and data extraction are discussed. To validate the accuracy of the test setup, the velocity field of the wall jet in quiescent ambient is obtained in a range of Reynolds number up to 10,000 and is compared with available data in the literatures. The mean velocity field and its main characteristics for the case of jet to counter-flow velocity ratio equal to 17.5 are discussed shortly.   </i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2> 

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> "The wall jet is a type of shear
layer flow along a wall that due to its initial momentum, at any station, its
streamwise velocity in some point is higher than the velocity of the external
flow" [1]. Boundary layer control in advanced aircrafts, film cooling of
combustion chambers and turbine blades, and air conditioning systems are
typical examples for engineering applications of wall jets.  The schematic of
the velocity distribution in a two-dimensional wall jet with a slot height of <i>b</i>
and jet discharge velocity of <i>U<sub>j</sub></i> is shown in Figure 1.  </p>

</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  The velocity profile shows a
maximum axial velocity, <i>U<sub>m</sub></i>, which occurs at height of <i>y<sub>m</sub></i>
(see Figure 1). There are two different shear flows in the wall jet. The first
one which starts from the wall and extends to the point of maximum velocity has
typical characteristics of a boundary layer and traditionally is called the
inner region. The second shear flow starts from the point of maximum velocity
and extends to the other edge of the flow. It is called the outer region and
has the characteristics of a free shear layer. Different researchers have tried
to find universal correlations for the velocity and scalar concentration
distribution in a wall jet. To this end, flow parameters from the outer region
and/or inner region have been used to normalize the velocity, concentration and
length scales to examine the self-similarity of the flow. The outer region
parameters which are traditionally used to find dimension-less scales for the
velocity field are the maximum streamwise velocity (<i>U<sub>m</sub></i>), the
height (<i>y<sub>m</sub></i>), and the height where the velocity becomes half
of the maximum velocity (<i>y<sub>1/2</sub></i>). </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Eriksson et al. [2] used two
components laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) technique to investigate the velocity
field of a two-dimensional slot wall jet in a water channel.  The height and
width of the slot were <i>b</i><i>&#8197;</i>= 9.6 mm and <i>w</i><i>&#8197;</i>=&#8197;460
mm, respectively. The Reynolds number of the jet based on the exit condition
was 9,600. The measurements were done from a distance of 0.05 mm above the wall
up to the outer region of the wall jet which allowed collecting velocity data
in the viscous sub-layer with high spatial resolution. They used outer region
scaling parameters and found that in the axial distances greater than 40&#8197;<i>b</i>,
the streamwise velocity profiles showed self-similar behavior in the form of:</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
In addition to slot wall jets, the three dimensional wall
jets were also investigated widely by other researchers. One of the important
characteristics of a three dimensional wall jet is higher growth rate in
spanwise direction compared to streamwise direction. The spreading rate of the
velocity in the spanwise direction is about 5.5 times greater than that of the
streamwise velocity [1]. Law and Herlina [3] reported the simultaneous
measurement of the velocity and scalar concentration field for a round wall jet
with diameter of <i>D</i><i>&#8197;</i>=&#8197;5.5 mm at three different jet
Reynolds numbers equal to 5500, 12200, and 13700. They used PIV and planar
laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) at the jet symmetry and lateral plane to find
both the streamwise and spanwise mean flow characteristics up to the axial
distance of 50&#8197;<i>D</i> from the jet outlet. By using the outer region
flow parameters for finding dimensionless velocity and concentration
distribution, their results showed self-similar velocity and concentration
profiles after an axial distance of 25<i>D</i> from the jet exit. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Investigation of flow
characteristics of jets issuing in streams can find application in many
engineering problems. Co-flowing jets, jets in cross-flow and jets in counter
flow are examples of this flow configuration. The efficient dilutions of
effluents and mixing enhancement in combustion chambers have been important
topics of research for many years. The jet in counter flow has higher mixing
efficiency compared to other configurations and it has a great potential to be
used in different industrial applications such as combustion chambers and
chemical reactors as previously shown by Yoda and
Fiedler [4], Chan and Lam [5] and Torres et al [6]. The dynamics of this
flow and its response to harmonic excitation was studied by Koing and Fiedler [7].
They conducted a flow visualization study of a 25 mm round jet in counter-flow
in a wind tunnel. For values of U<sub>R</sub> &lt; 1.4 they saw the regular vortex shedding
and stable behavior of the jet, while for greater velocity ratios random
fluctuations were observed. Flow excitation could not provide coherency or a
change in the penetration length based on their experiments. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
One of the interesting applications of the jet in
counter-flow is the potential ability of this flow configuration in hypersonic
speeds to change the effective aerodynamic shape of a flying object, thus
reducing the associated drag force [8]. Huge drag force and aerodynamic heating
are a challenging problem in hypersonic flights. The forward injection of high
energy plasma in the stagnation area can modify the shape of the strong bow
shock in front of the object and converts it to a series of weaker oblique
shocks with less drag. In addition, it can provide a layer of cooler gas around
the object which reduces the thermal stresses on the body [9-11].   </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  To study the wall jet in
counter-flow, it is important to understand the behavior of a free jet in
counter-flow. It is the flow of a jet in an opposing stream when the jet exit
velocity (<i>U<sub>j</sub></i>) is greater than the velocity of the opposed
current (<i>U<sub>0</sub></i>). Figure 2 shows a schematic of a free
round jet with diameter <i>D</i> in a uniform counter-flow.  </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Like other kinds of jet flows, a
potential core which has velocity and concentration equal to those of the jet
discharge point forms in the beginning. The length of this potential core is
less than that of a jet in quiescent surroundings as shown by Or et al [12]. As
described by Torres et al [6], after the potential core, a transition length
exists for the jet to develop the well known self-similar velocity patterns.
The region of the potential core and transition to the self-similar area is
called the zone of flow establishment (Z.F.E.). The jet penetrates into the
opposed flow up to axial and radial penetration lengths of <i>X<sub>p</sub></i>
and <i>Y<sub>p</sub></i> which are a function of the jet to counter-flow
velocity ratio (<i>U<sub>R</sub></i>). The behaviour of the jet up to the point
where it reaches to the maximum penetration height is similar to a jet flowing
into quiescent ambient surroundings. The region between the zone of flow
establishment and the point of maximum height is called the established flow
zone (E.F.Z.).  Finally the jet loses its momentum and ends in a stagnation
point and is carried back with the opposing flow. This happens in the mixing
zone area (M.Z.).  </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
The formation of large scale
vortical structures due to the strong shear layers between the jet and opposed
flow creates random oscillations with large amplitudes which cause higher
spreading rates compared to other jet and flow configurations like co-flow and
cross-flow jets. Although there are many publications related to the discharge
of a simple round jet in a uniform counter flow, the problem of a wall jet in
counter flow has not been investigated completely. This flow configuration can
have potential application in mixing of fluids and cooling of the heated walls
in combustion chambers. The objective of this research is measuring and
studying of the flow field of a round wall jet in counter flow. For this
purpose a test setup is designed and a series of experiments were conducted to
find the velocity field of the wall jet in counter flow with PIV and by using
four cameras to cover a large area of this complex flow. The test setup is
validated with available data in the literatures for the wall jet flow in
quiescent environment. The experimental procedure, data analysis and several
results are discussed. </p>

<h2>2. Experimental Setup </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
The experiments were done in the
water channel facility at Mechanical Engineering Department at the University
of Alberta. The size of the water channel cross section was 680×480 mm<sup>2</sup>
and its total length was about 5000 mm, see Figure 3. It had a closed loop
circuit and two pumps returned the water from the end plenum chamber to the
front one. The volume flow rate in the water channel was adjusted by means of
two valves located after each pump. It was also possible to change the height
of water in the channel by adjusting the angle of a gate located at the end of
the channel.  These two mechanisms were used to adjust the velocity of the
flow. The water flowed from the upstream plenum chamber through an S shape
nozzle with a contraction ratio of 2 and after passing from a flow straightener
entered the channel. The flow straightener width was 90 mm which was made from
thin copper sheet and had a mesh size of about 20×20 mm<sup>2</sup>. A grid
turbulence generator was located about 150 mm in front of the flow
straightener.  The grid turbulence generator was made from stainless steel bars
with width of 20 mm and thickness of 4 mm and had a mesh size of about 55×55 mm<sup>2</sup>. 
</p>

<figcaption>

</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
A periscope located after the
turbulence generator was used to reflect the laser sheet in the channel from
the upstream. In this experiment the channel flow velocity was set to be equal
to <i>U<sub>0</sub></i> = 4cm/s and the turbulence intensity was about 3.5 %. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
A flat plate made from acrylic
with size of 400×2000 mm<sup>2</sup> was installed in the side wall of the
channel far from the channel boundary layer. The distance of the flat plate
leading edge was about 2m from the beginning of the channel test section and
had a chamfer upstream to minimize the stagnation area. It also was equipped
with a trip strip to ensure a turbulent boundary layer with a set leading
edge.  The plate was equipped with a brass pipe with inner diameter equal to <i>D</i><i>&#8197;</i>=&#8197;8.84
mm and thickness of 0.1 mm to provide the jet flow in opposite direction of the
channel flow, as shown in figure 4. The length of the pipe was 920 mm (104&#8197;<i>D</i>)
which provided a fully developed flow in the pipe end. The brass pipe was held
parallel to the flat plate and in the middle height by a simple supporting bar.
The distance of the jet exit plane from the leading edge of the flat plate was
1200 mm. The jet discharge plane was about 40&#8197;cm far from the anchoring
point to the pipe holder unit. Therefore, the interference effect of the pipe
holder in the jet and opposed flow was negligible. </p>

<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
The jet was fed by a pressurized stainless steel tank and
the channel water was used to fill the tank during the experiments. The
compressed air pressure in the tank was always about 350 kPa. At the beginning
of the brass pipe a flow straightener was installed to suppress any secondary
flow or vortices before entering the brass pipe. It consists of a set of straws
with length of 120 mm and diameter of 2 mm located in a tube with diameter of
25 mm. this tube was connected to the brass pipe by a smooth converging nozzle.
A flexible hose with approximate length of 5m and inner diameter of 25mm was
used to connect the pressurized tank to the flow straightener. A flow
controller was installed on the jet feeding line to set the jet discharge
velocity during the tests. That was a LCR-5LPM series of precise flow
controllers made by Alicat Scientific Company. In this study the range of
variation for velocity ratio was 1.3 &lt; <i>U<sub>R</sub></i> &lt; 25. The
range of Reynolds number variation based on the jet diameter was about 500 &lt;
<i>Re</i> &lt; 10,000. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
To find the velocity field,
particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used. PIV is a non intrusive technique for
measuring the velocity field in a flow. It appeared about 30 years ago and is
an essential measurement technique in fluid dynamics researches. In this
research four cameras were used and the resultant velocity field from them were
combined to have a large field of view covering the whole penetrating length of
the jet. The cameras were ImagerProX4M with data depth of 14 bits and
resolution of 2048×2048 pixels equipped with Nikon AF NIKKOR lenses with focal
length of 50 mm. They were located in a line such that their fields of view had
about 15 mm overlap with each other, see Figure 3. With the set of lenses were
used in this study, the field of view for each camera was about 190×190 mm<sup>2</sup>.
Therefore, combining the images from these cameras provided a total field of
view of 720×180 mm<sup>2</sup> which was large enough to cover the whole
penetration region of the jet in counter-flow. A glass screen was installed on
the water channel to have contact with the water surface to suppress the waves.
</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
Illumination were provided by a
dual cavity Nd:YAG laser with wave length of 532 nm. The laser was a Quanta Ray
PIV-&#8197;400 series made by Spectra Physics and had a maximum energy of about
100 mJ in each pulse at 10 Hz repeating rate. The laser beam was transferred to
the sheet generator with a laser guiding arm. The laser sheet with a thickness
of about 1 mm in the test section was provided by a cylindrical lens and was directed
to the channel by means of a periscope, see Figure 5. </p>

<figure>
<img src="003%20-%20IJMEM_files/image005.jpg" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 5. The laser,
guiding arm, sheet generator, and periscope.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
This should be noted that due to
low velocity of the channel and very stiff and solid structure of the periscope
and the mounting bars, no vibration observed in the laser sheet. The laser
sheet was adjusted to be parallel to the channel floor and pass through the jet
central plane. The channel flow was seeded by hollow glass spheres with mean
diameter of 18 µm and to have a uniform seeding density the pressurized tank
was fed by the channel flow. The PIV image recording and processing were done
by Davis8.2 provided by LaVision Inc. </p>

<h2> 3. Data Acquisition</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
When the camera's orientation and
position were fixed and the test rig was ready with all components, the
calibration of cameras was done to find the geometrical mappings between the
image space and the real coordinate system in the test setup. The calibration
target which was used in this PIV study had a size of 740×250 mm<sup>2</sup>
and was consisted of filled circles with diameter of 3&#8197;mm and centre to
centre spacing of 15 mm. The calibration procedure for all 4 cameras was done
simultaneously. A 3<sup>rd</sup> order polynomial fitting was selected for the
calibration and the rms of fitting errors was less than 0.1%. For the PIV image
acquisition, double frame and double exposure setting was selected.</p>

In the statistical analysis of
the physical phenomena with finite data series, the number of samples is an
important factor to obtain the real and accurate properties of the problem
under study. In this project, finding the average behavior of the flow of a
wall jet in counter-flow was the main goal. Therefore, based on the initial
tests which were done before the main tests, a simple analysis was done to find
how many PIV images are enough to obtain this goal. The method was to examine
the behavior of the average velocity versus number of images and the
distribution of velocity data at several points in the velocity field. The
points were selected to be close to the shear layers of the flat plate boundary
layer and the interaction zone of the jet and opposed flow in the jet boundary.
Based on the physics of the problem, at these points which are shown
schematically in figure 6 the velocity has more fluctuations. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
The results for point D are shown in figure 7 for the case
where the jet to counter-flow velocity ratio was <i>U<sub>R</sub></i><i><sub>&#8197;</sub></i>=&#8197;20.
It is seen that almost before 1000 images the average velocity approaches to a
constant value or predictable behavior. Data distribution also shows that the
recorded samples are acceptable since the major portion of them bouncing around
the mean value. This trend was observed for points A, B, and C, too. Therefore,
1000 PIV images were recorded at each velocity ratio to obtain a valid average
flow field of the wall jet in counter-flow. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">   In PIV experiments the
setting of the time interval between the frames is an important issue which is
depended on the physics of the flow and the processing scheme. Based on Davis
manuals, the time difference between the images must be such that the displacement
of identical particles in the image space is greater than 0.1 pixel and less
than 25% of the interrogation window size. In the current experiments, the
velocity field has areas with high velocity (e.g. at the jet discharge zone)
and areas which the velocity vanishes (e.g. close to the wall or stagnation
areas at the end of the jet penetration). Therefore, it was decided to do the
experiments with one small time interval (~ 400 µs) suitable for the high
velocity regions and one large time interval (3000 µs) to capture the velocity
in low speed zones of the flow field. Then in the post processing of the data
these two velocity field were combined with each other to find the whole
velocity field. </p>

<h2> 4. Data Processing </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
Data processing was done by Davis 8.2
on a graphics processing unit (GPU) with total number of 1536 cores. Different
schemes were selected and tested to find the most efficient and accurate scheme
with lower amount of spurious vectors. Different multi-pass sequential cross
correlations with decreasing window size were examined. Finally, the
interrogation window size of 64×64 pixels with 50% overlap and 4 passes
followed by a 16×16 pixels window size with 50% overlap and 3 passes was
selected. With this processing scheme, it was found that the spatial resolution
of the vector field is about 0.73×0.73 mm<sup>2</sup>. This processing scheme
was used to find the whole velocity field in this experimental study. In the
vector post processing section, just a median filter was applied to get rid of
the spurious vectors and fill the empty areas with the interpolation of neighbor
vectors. Then, the average flow filed was found for each field of view. The
next step was stitching the flow fields of the cameras to each other to find
the total flow field of the interaction of the jet and counter-flow. Since the
field of view of the cameras had overlap with each other, this overlap was
found and taken out during the stitching process. A simple schematic of the
cameras field of view and their overlap is shown in figure 8.</p>

</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
The vector fields were imported
to MATLAB for stitching and further post processing. The exact amount of the
overlap of cameras was found by investigating the image of a measuring tape
located in the same plane where the PIV images were taken, see Figure 9. Searching
was done on the images of the measuring tape from 4 cameras to find the common
values. After finding the amount of overlaps, the images were cut with pixel
accuracy to get rid of the common areas. This procedure was repeated for all
velocity fields captured by each camera. So, for each data set the final
velocity vector was extracted and used for further analysis. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
The precision error in the
measurement of the velocity field was estimated to be around 0.3%.  In order to
reduce the bias errors, the rules of thumb mentioned by Raffel et al. [13] was
followed. The total amount of uncertainty in the mean velocity measurement was
evaluated to be around 2.5%. </p>

<h2> 5. Results</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
An experiment is designed to
measure the velocity field of a wall jet in counter-flow at different jet to
counter-flow velocity ratios, up to <i>U<sub>R</sub></i> = 25. The main
boundary conditions in this flow field are related to the counter-current flow,
the boundary layer of the flat plate, and the jet outlet velocity. The flow
condition of the channel was a uniform flow with the velocity of 4&#8197;cm/s
and turbulence intensity of 3.5%. The boundary layer of the flat plate was
tripped to be turbulent by a guitar string installed at a distance of 100 mm
after the plate leading edge. The normalized velocity profile in the boundary
layer of the plate at a distance of <i>x</i> =&#8197;25&#8197;<i>D</i> from the
jet outlet plane is shown in Figure 10 a. The typical laminar and turbulent
boundary layer profiles over flat plates described by Schlichting [14] are
shown for comparison.  It is clear that the experimental boundary layer
velocity profile is similar to the turbulent profile; the discrepancy is due to
the low Reynolds number artificially transitioned flow in these experiments. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
Detailed jet velocity profiles
were obtained for the free jet exiting the brass pipe in the absence of the
flat plate. Figure 10 b shows the normalized mean axial velocity profiles at
different Reynolds numbers based on the jet diameter at a distance of 0.4 <i>D</i>
from the outlet plane. It is seen that with increasing Reynolds number, the
velocity profiles become fill out like a turbulent pipe flow and show minimal
variation for <i>Re</i> &gt; 5000. It will be shown later that at low Reynolds
number, the jet velocity decay starts at a greater distance from the discharge
plane.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
In order to ensure the capability and accuracy of this test
setup, initial experiments were done to measure the velocity field of the wall
jet when the water channel was not running. The results were then compared with
the existing data in the literatures for three dimensional round wall jets in
quiescent ambient. Figure 11 shows a small portion of the axial velocity
contour of the round wall jet at <i>Re</i><i>&#8197;</i>=1,000 and <i>Re</i>&#8197;=&#8197;9,500.
It is seen that at lower Reynolds number, the axial velocity decay is very slow
and there is a long core in which the velocity is almost constant. At the
initial region, the jet shows laminar behavior and after a certain distance it
becomes turbulent. On the other hand, when the Reynolds number is high enough,
the jet velocity decay starts immediately after the jet exit and the jet is
completely turbulent, see Figure 11b.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
The normalized maximum velocity
decay of the wall jet versus axial distance is shown in figure 12a for range of
Reynolds numbers from <i>Re</i>&#8197;=&#8197;2,000 to 10,000. It is seen that
for <i>Re</i> &gt;7.3×10<sup>3</sup> the velocity profiles collapse on each
other and show self similar behavior. Figure 11b shows that for the self
similar velocity decay and axial distances of <i>x/D</i>&#8197;&gt;15, a power
law relation (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=95%) can be used to represent the velocity
distribution in the form of:</p>

wall jet provided by a round nozzle.</p>

0.04. Therefore, a linear fit (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=95%) for the half width
velocity of the round wall jet can be proposed as:</p>

As figure 14 shows, the velocity profile proposed by Verhoff [15] can

the form of:</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
From the above results one can
conclude that the measured velocity field of the round wall jet in still
ambient has complete agreement with similar experiments done by other
researchers. This proves the capabilities of the designed test setup for
measuring the velocity field of the round wall jet with the presence of the
counter-flowing stream in the water channel. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
The whole flow field for the wall
jet in counter-flow at <i>U<sub>R</sub> </i>= 17.5 corresponding to jet
Reynolds number of <i>Re</i>&#8197;&#8197;=7,300 is shown in figures 15.  As it
is seen, the jet penetrates and exchange momentum with the counter-flow and
finally reaches to zero velocity at maximum penetration length of  <i>X<sub>p</sub></i>
= 64 <i>D</i>. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
Figure 16 shows a schematic of the stream lines in a 2-D
plane along with the loci of <i>u</i><i>&#8197;</i>=&#8197;0 regions. It
clearly shows the path of fluid elements toward the stagnation area and their
turning. There is a recirculation region close to the stagnation area which
contains a big swirl at <i>x/D</i> = 48. The axial velocity profiles at
different positions are shown in figure 17. It is seen that the profiles have a
typical shape of a wall jet flow at initial regions. Then, the quick decay of
axial velocity profile starts around <i>x/D</i> = 40 and continues to reach to
zero velocity at maximum penetration point. Different length scales of the flow
can be used to normalize these velocity profiles like what was done for a wall
jet in quiescent environment. </p>

<h2> 6. Conclusion</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> The purpose of this research was to design an experimental procedure for studying the behavior of a round wall jet in counter-flow. The wall jet and counter-flowing jet were defined and their typical applications were discussed briefly. The velocity field of a three dimensional round wall jet exiting from a pipe is analyzed at different Reynolds numbers ranging from 500 to 10,000 for still ambient. The results show complete agreement with available information in the literatures. The self-similarity of wall jet velocity data was observed for Re >7,000. The maximum velocity decays with power of -1.08 versus the axial distance and the normalized axial velocity profiles collapse on each other for <i>x/D</i> > 30.  The velocity field of the wall jet in counter-flow at velocity ratio of<i> U<sub>R</sub></i>= 17.5 is discussed shortly. It was observed that the jet penetrates up to <i>x/D</i> =64 and there exist a large recirculation region close to the stagnation area. </p>
