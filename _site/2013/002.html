    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>Pathological tremor is a common neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary rhythmic oscillation of body parts. Available treatments are often insufficiently effective or are accompanied by severe side effects. This work proposes a lightweight, portable elbow tremor suppression orthosis using an electromagnetic brake (EB) with on-off actuation scheme. The device reduces tremor amplitude and could potentially be donned under clothes. At this stage of the project, the focus is on action tremor (postural) such as essential tremor. The elbow joint is commonly affected by tremor; it can be modelled as a single Degree Of Freedom (DOF) joint and was selected to test our hypothesis and prototype. The orthosis is actuated by an (EB). The algorithm alternates between full suppression and no suppression, and relies on the high frequency nature of tremor relative to the frequency of Activities of Daily Living (ADL). A MEMS gyro signal is processed to assess the tremor component. The system successfully reduces tremor amplitude with over 88% of tremor signal power reduction.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p class="body">In
broadest terms, tremor can be classified as either physiological or
pathological. The former being normal and usually imperceptible to the naked
eye while the latter is a serious disorder afflicting 3-4% of the population [1]
causing disability and social exclusion.</p>

<p class="body">Pathological
tremor is witnessed in almost all body parts, such as legs, head and trunk [2],
however it is most common in the upper limbs such as the shoulder, elbow and
wrist [3]. The most prevalent and debilitating tremor disorders are Essential
and Parkinsonian tremors [2, 4]. Other tremors include Dystonic and Cerebellar.
Some causes for tremor are head injuries, multiple sclerosis, Friedreich's ataxia,
Joseph's disease, some strokes and tumors, and chronic alcohol intoxication and
metabolic poisoning [5]. The underlying mechanisms behind tremors are not fully
understood. Common available treatments are medication, surgical and deep brain
stimulation. Alternative treatments include physical therapy, relaxation
techniques and assistive accessories. Despite these treatments, a large (40-50%)
portion of patients do not find relief and sufficient improvement [6]. Because
there is no definite cure, treatments are aimed at minimizing disability. Tremor
disorders are often classified by their activation mode, i.e. rest, postural,
action or task specific. </p>

<p class="body">Research
on tremor suppression devices is a relatively recent field. Several suppression
systems have been suggested to date. In an early work, a dumped joystick was
developed by an MIT group [7]. Aisen et al. [8] developed the Controlled-Energy-Dissipation
Orthosis CEDO, a 3 Degree Of Freedom DOF wheel chair mounted device, permitting
table top activities, that connects to the user's wrist and applies velocity
proportional damping loads by means of magnetic particle
brakes [8].  Some biomechanical loading
ambulatory devices have been proposed. Kotovsky et al. developed a flexion and
extension, wrist orthosis in which the actuator was a viscous beam that applied
passive velocity proportional resistance [9]. An inherent disadvantage of this
design is that viscous resistance is applied to all motions. A similar concept using
magneto-rheological fluids and actively controlling the attenuation, was done
by Loureiro et al., [10]. More recently a wearable orthosis for tremor
assessment and suppression (WOTAS) of the upper limbs was suggested, with 3 DOF
for the elbow and wrist flexion and extension [11]. A brushless DC motor with a
harmonic gearbox is used for actuation in an active suppression method. Other
types of orthotics have used functional electrical stimulation
(FES) [12, 13, 14, 15]. An interesting study by Swollow et al. [16] proposes
the use of ceramic based piezoelectric materials in a glove structure [16]. Work
has also been done investigating conducting polymer actuators as well as magneto-rheological
dampers [17, 18].</p>

<p class="body">One of the common
tasks in suppressing undesired motion superimposed on a desired one is that of
separating the two motion components. Several approaches have been suggested in
the literature. Rosen et al. have used pursuit tracking data in order to
separate the desired and undesired components [5]. Rocon et al. have tested
several algorithms to isolate the volitional motion component, and by
subtracting this component from the total motion obtained the tremor component [4].
Using a filter to obtain the voluntary component resulted in a time lag; an
adaptive algorithm, the Benedict–Bordner filter, was then chosen to estimate
voluntary movement. A second algorithm, the weighted-frequency Fourier linear
combiner (WFLC), was used to estimate the tremor signal parameters. Two
approaches are then implemented using the tremor signal, a passive impedance
force and an opposing velocity profile by the actuators. Ando et al. have used

electromyography (EMG) signals to detect the voluntary movement using a low
pass filter, Short-Time Fourier Transformation (STFT) and Neural Network (NN)
to process the signal [24].  Another study by Widjaja et al. considered
accelerometers and EMG sensor fusion for FES application using a Kalman Filter,
and a low pass filter with a Bandwidth-Limited Fourier linear combiner (a
variation on WFLC) algorithm for the tremor signal, [12].</p>

<p class="body">A drawback with many
of these systems is the bulkiness and electrical and mechanical power
constraints. In this work we aim to demonstrate an alternative to previously
suggested wearable tremor suppression systems.</p>

<h4>2. System</h4>

<p class="body">The elbow orthosis is shown
in Figure 1 and described in this section. The objective of the design was to
test the feasibility of using a new type of actuator that can lead to a lightweight,
portable exoskeleton. A micro Electromagnetic Brake (EB) was selected. It is
able to generate relatively high torques (refer to Table 1) while keeping the
system non-bulky and light. The main orthosis components were 3D printed; carbon
fibre was utilized to strengthen a section of the upper arm component. Two
gyros and a potentiometer (see Figure 1 (b-c)) were incorporated to measure
angular velocity and position respectively. </p>

<p class="subhead"> 2. 1. Electromechanical
Elbow Orthosis Description </p>

<p class="body">The orthosis frame was
3D printed using an ABS material variant which is lightweight yet rigid. The
type of brake used is an electromagnetic friction brake (EFB), (Chaintail
MBG0S2AA). A magnetic field is generated when an excitation voltage is applied,
which in turn draws the rotor plate against the stator friction surface. An EB
possess several advantages when compared to DC motors; EBs generally have a
higher torque and lower power consumption for a given weight/volume ratio. Control
of an EB can be relatively simple with minimal circuitry required for actuation.
Specifically for an EFB there are also several inherent disadvantages such as
low repeatability and accuracy. These types of brakes generally perform best at
the top portion of their torque range since their intended design is primarily
for stopping rather than slipping applications.</p>

<p class="body">Physical and
electromechanical properties for the chosen brake are provided in Table 1. A 1:4
gear reduction system was implemented to increase the operational torque range.
Expected elbow torque was estimated from literature sources of tremor and
exoskeleton devices as well as data about
healthy individuals [19, 20]. The device gross weight is 942&nbsp;g.</p>

<p class="body"> The EFB static
torque-voltage relation was obtained by performing a series of tests in which
varying loads were applied. Voltages and torques were recorded to find the
static torque. In practice torque is unstable towards the lower range and the
rotor may not be drawn to the stator. Additional work may be required to
characterize further this phenomenon.</p>

<p class="body">In order to conform to
both right and left handed individuals, the device was designed with the main
frame parts symmetric as shown in Figure 1. This reduced the number of parts,
and consequently devices that needed to be fabricated. By simply removing the EFB,
gears and potentiometer, and installing them on either side, the device fits on
either arm. The rotor is part of the magnetic circuit, and the assembly
distance of the brake rotor from the stator may also affect performance and
response time; consequently we tested the current build-up as can be seen in Figure
2. The rise and fall time are less than 50&nbsp;ms, taking into account
hardware and software delays.</p>

<p class="subhead"> 2. 2. Sensors, Circuitry
and Software (Control Architecture) </p>

<p class="body">Two MEMS gyros (Gyro
Breakout Board - IDG500 Dual 500°/s) were installed on the forearm and upper
arm of the orthosis. This allowed calculating the relative elbow joint velocity
by subtraction of the signals. The selection of gyros was motivated by several
considerations; they measure absolute angular velocity and are not affected by
gravity. Gyros also have a high signal to noise ratio and a large dynamic range
[11, 21]. The prices of MEMS sensors have declined in recent years leading to availability
of small, lightweight and affordable sensors.</p>

<p class="body">A single revolution
potentiometer (Panasonic EVW-AE4001B14) was used to obtain joint angular data.
The EFB was powered by a pack of AA batteries. NI LabVIEW 2010 and a Personal
Computer (PC) were used for the control implementation. A Pulse Width
Modulation (PWM) signal to a MOSFET switch allowed regulation of the excitation
of the EFB.</p>


<h4>3. Control Strategy and
Performance</h4>

<p class="body">The control scheme
developed was aimed at investigating and exploiting the functionality of an EB
for tremor suppression while taking into consideration several limitations with
the current prototype. These limitations include compliancy of the device frame,
and limited repeatability and accuracy of the EFB.</p>

<p class="body">A
particular property of pathological tremor that is often relied on in the
control design is the frequency property of the tremor motion component. It is
well known that tremor tends to appear in the 3-12&nbsp;Hz range [10, 22], while
the frequency range of ADL is considered to fall below 2&nbsp;Hz [23].</p>

<p class="body">Our approach in this
work was to demonstrate the tremor suppression performance for an on-off braking
scheme. Namely, we sought to establish a minimal activation period for the
brake as well as define the timing to initiate and stop the brake.</p>


<p class="subhead"> 3. 1. Simplified Control
Scheme </p>

<p class="body">Because this type of
actuator, to the authors' knowledge, has not been implemented in a similar application,
we developed two methods to examine the feasibility. Initially, we tested
braking with a threshold method. This essentially involved deriving the
acceleration from the gyro information and activating the brake when the
acceleration surpassed a threshold value. The rational for this idea is driven
by the assumption that tremor movement exhibits higher accelerations than
normal volitional movement. The results showed promise and the current
algorithm was implemented which involves a 6<sup>th</sup> order elliptic High Pass
Filter (HPF) with a 2&nbsp;Hz cut-off and a lead phase response. The motivation
for using an HPF is that we seek to extract the tremor movement component, which
can be viewed as representing the activation command to the EFB. Since the
actuator is inherently one that absorbs rather than emits energy, the voluntary
signal component could not drive the actuation. An additional benefit is the
lead phase shift of the specific filter model used, which contributes to a minimal
delay of the actuation. On the other hand, implementing a LPF and subtracting
from the total signal to obtain the tremor component could result in added delay.</p>

<p class="body">Once the tremor signal
was obtained, it was necessary to determine the timing and duration of the
braking. This kind of approach would benefit from additional processing of the
tremor signal to estimate its parameters in order to represent it more
reliably, however perhaps less so than in continuous actuation approaches as
mentioned in section 1. Another rational for this approach is that during the
time that the brake is off, no resistance is applied to the movement. Part of
our objective is to investigate the minimal period of time required to suppress
the tremor. This approach is different than those suggested by other
researchers. A potential disadvantage to this approach is a less smooth motion which
may be less comfortable to users, however it is hypothesized that improving adaptability
and accuracy of dampening forces, through actuator performance and more
advanced algorithms, can help mitigate this issue.</p>

<p class="body">Recalling our on-off suppression
approach and observing the oscillatory shape of the isolated tremor signal, we
selected a point for applying the braking as shown inFigure 3. Considering
a hypothetical case in which full suppression is achieved, the motion-based
sensing methods used would become impracticable. That is an extreme scenario;
to approach it we seek to initiate the suppression soon after the tremor motion
begins. In practice this translates to activating the suppression soon after
the angle crosses the tremor zero level (DC), or equivalently when the velocity
reaches a peak. Velocity proportional braking was initially implemented. In
order to achieve consistent performance and alleviate some of the actuator and
assembly limitations, a fixed braking level was performed. It is important to
note the brake timing is dependent on the signal phase shift, as dictated by
the filter frequency response, which in turn is a function of the tremor
frequency. The control scheme can adjust the brake timing based on the tremor frequency.
The braking duration is set to 25&nbsp;ms. It is possible that the current, and
hence torque, may not reach full value within this activation time (see Figure 2b).</p>

<p class="subhead">3. 2. Testing Protocol
and Results </p>

<p class="body">Ethics approval was
obtained for the device from SFU office of research ethics. Three healthy
volunteers were recruited to participate in the testing. The protocol consisted
of donning the device and practicing elbow tremor motion with no active suppression
for 30&nbsp;s at both 3 and 4&nbsp;Hz. Once the volunteer felt comfortable
performing the arm movement at the desired frequency, they then practiced with
the device in suppression mode (suppression on) for another 30&nbsp;s at each
frequency. Finally 2-3 repetitions of testing were performed. To assist the
volunteers, a user interface displayed the tremor frequency while the movements
were performed.</p>

<p class="body">The angular velocity,
position and Power Spectral Density (PSD) results for participant 3 and 2 are
shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 respectively.</p>

Figure 5.  Volunteer 2, 4 Hz data (a) Angular velocity data (b) Angle data (c) PSD for suppressed and unsuppressed phases. Suppression begins approximately at 33 s.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">Testing at 3&nbsp;Hz is
shown in Figure 4. The suppression mode ends approximately at 34 seconds and is
marked by a shaded line. A clear reduction in tremor amplitude for both angular
velocity and angle can be observed. The PSD is computed separately, using an
equal number of samples, for the suppressed and unsuppressed phases and also
demonstrates attenuation of the signal. The ratio in power reduction for
volunteer 3 between the suppressed and unsuppressed phases is 88%. Similarly, in
Figure 5, testing at 4&nbsp;Hz is performed. The suppression starts around the
33 second mark (marked by a shaded line). The volunteer tremor amplitude is
reduced as can be seen in the velocity, angle and PSD signal. The power
reduction for volunteer 2 is about 88%. Volunteer 2 in Figure 5 successfully
performs volitional movement (about 5 deg) superimposed on the tremor movement.
Since a goal of this project is to leave the voluntary movement component
unaffected, this is a good indication of the system potential. It is also worth
mentioning that testing on healthy subjects may induce artifacts. This aspect will
need to be further tested with individuals having Essential Tremor.</p>

<h4>4. Conclusion</h2>

<p class="body">Essential Tremor is a prevalent
neurological disorder that can be highly debilitating. New and improved
treatments are needed so that more afflicted individuals can find relief. This
work demonstrates the feasibility of using an EB to suppress upper limb elbow
tremor. A novel on/off suppression paradigm was proposed and tested on 3 healthy
volunteers. The results showed promise in achieving a reduction of tremor using
a new type of lightweight actuator able to generate high torques. Future work
may be directed at improving the signal processing and timing algorithm as well
as EFB actuator performance. The algorithm suggested here relies on the
repetitive characteristics of tremor and in future work a more robust and
adaptive method could be implemented to better model the tremor signal.
Implementation on a real time system may allow improved performance as well
through accurate timing and duration of the braking.</p>
