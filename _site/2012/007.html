<h2>1. Introduction</h2> 


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The concept of resolution of a manufacturing
system is very important, especially when it is referred to a nanofabrication
tool. In top-down nanofabrication technologies, elements have to be not only
very small, but also be placed very close to each other. In many cases a
manufacturing system can deal with small sizes but not with very small
separations. A typical example is found in Electron Beam Lithography (EBL)
systems where the distance between elements is much lower than the expected
from the diameter of the electron beam due to the forward and backward
scatterings in both the resist layer and the substrate.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Because Focused Ion Beam (FIB) systems does
not require any resist layer (Ampere, 2004, Langford et al., 2007), it can be used
in cases where EBL systems are unable to place elements very close to each
other. However, in FIB systems is found that the minimum distance between
elements is larger than the expected from the core part size of the ion beam.
This is due to the tail part of the electrical current distribution of the ion
beam in a focusing column suffering from distortions (Rempfer
and Mauck, 1988). Therefore, it is necessary to know
the sizes of the core and the tail parts tail of the ion beam in a FIB system
in order to determine its real possibilities in nanofabrication.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Previous works by other authors to measure the ion beam size are based
on the sweeping the beam across a knife edge method. In this method, the ion beam
is scanned across a metallic sharp knife edge and  recording the intensity of the secondary
electron current at every position of the ion beam. The distance between the
positions of the beam at which the integrated current profile is the15% and the
85% of the maximum determines the ion beam size (Orloff
and Sato, 1991). However, other studies have demonstrated that this method
suffers from errors when it is applied to very low ion current beams (~ 1 pA). These errors are in particular due to uncertainties
arising from a high noise level resulting from ion beam electrical currents
levels several times smaller than the normal current levels. In these studies,
the authors use other methods to measure the actual sizes of an ion beam. These
methods are based on: mechanical probes that are placed between the beam and
the target (Gabriel Lopes et al., 2011, Sosolik et
al., 2000) which don't provide very low resolution specially when dealing with
low ion beam currents (~ 1 pA), or on exposing a
target to the ion beam and measuring the damage done to it (Wang and Wang 1996,
Park et al. 2004) which requires complicated samples preparation and not
standard instrumentation equipment for AES analysis to obtain the Ga concentration profiles in the parallel direction to the
incident beam, or on mathematical simulation being the ion beam approximated by a Gaussian distribution (Petit et al., 2005
and Orloff et al. 1991).</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">We present
in this paper a new experimental method to measure the ion beam profile in
terms of beam current density at any distance from the centre of an ion beam
with a resolution of few nanometres. This method implies the fabrication by FIB
of several arrays of trenches having different periods of values ranging from
larger to smaller than the expected diameter of the ion beam. A special scan
technique during the fabrication of the arrays of trenches has to be used in
order to prevent the formation of oblique planes at the bottom and top of the trenches. This is followed by
measurement of the depth of the trenches by Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) that
has to be dotted with a special tip having a very small curvature radius.
Finally, uncomplicated calculations have to be done. The method is applied to
the ion beam current of a FIB system carrying a current of 1 pA. </p>

<h2>2. Arrays Fabrication and AFM Measurements</h2>
<h4>2. 1. Experimental</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">We have used a FIB dotted with a new patented
liquid metal Ga ions source with an apex radius less
than 10 microns. It has only one column (the one for the ion beam) with
electrostatic optic elements (lens and deflectors) and a high quality secondary
electrons detector. The column has a fast ion beam blanker that is activated to
measure the ion beam current. Ions are then directed to a Faraday cup connected
to a pico-ammeter. Focusing and astigmatism
correction are made by sputtering the silicon surface during 3 seconds at a
magnification of 200K, near the writing field where the array of trenches are
going to be fabricated. The created crater is visualised and the quality of its
image is optimised by changing the working distance. At the same time, the
astigmatism corrections is made by wobbling the image of the crater and
adjusting the aperture position until the image becomes sharp during the
wobbling with not shift in X or Y direction. Final astigmatism correction is
made by further focusing using the settings of the stigmator
lens. Focusing and astigmatism correction are finished when the upper part of
the crater is a perfect circle with a diameter of less than 50 nm </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The values of the etching parameters are: ion
energy 30 keVs, length of the trenches in the arrays
10 µm, step size of the beam during the scans 1 nm, ion beam current 1 pA, line dose 10 nC/cm equivalent
to an etching time of 10 ms per trench, and array
periods from 65 nm down to 20 nm with also some isolated trenches. The number
of trenches in the array (width of the array) was selected so that the total
fabrication time for every array was less than 0.5
seconds and
therefore the mechanical and thermal stage drift with time was negligible (Petit et al., 2005). The total dose was supplied in
100 scans (etched depth/scan ~ 0.16 nm),
thus avoiding the appearing of stepped surfaces at the bottom and top of the trenches from scan to scan and so the
possible variation of the sputtering yield of the Ga+
ions arriving to the target with the incident angle (Qiangmin Wei et al.). They report that for incident angle
less than 10<sup>o</sup> relative to
the normal to the target, the sputtering yield is practically the same as at 0<sup>o</sup>.
In our case, due to the mentioned technique of scanning, this angle is always
less than 4<sup>o</sup> at <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>the bottom
and top of the trenches. These parts of the trenches are crucial for the
proposed method in this paper. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">For AFM measurements, we have used a nanoScope V from Veeco (Webb-1),
dotted with a special tip having a curvature radius of 2 nm. The step size of
the probe during the measures was 1 nm. This ensures a minimum error in the
measures of the depth of the trenches.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">As material for etching, we have used a 20 nm
thick layer of Platinum deposited by sputtering. The reason why we have used
Platinum instead of a more common material such as silicon can be understood by
observing the figure 1.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">When platinum is used (figure 1a), the
surface next to the trench has the original roughness of the material.</p>

<figcaption>

</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">However when silicon is used (figure 1b), the
surface next to the line shows a large roughness with peaks-shapes of about 1.5 nm above de original silicon surface. These
peaks are due to the classical redeposition of the
backscattered silicon particles from the trench as a result of a pure physical
silicon etching mechanism. The higher mean free path of the backscattered
platinum particles from the trench avoids redeposition
of the etched platinum into the trenches, allowing the trenches to be placed
closer to each other and therefore it is possible to use periods smaller than
the diameter of the ion beam; this is essential to obtain the ion beam profile
as it will be shown later in the paper. 
For a line dose of 10 nC/cm,
the etched depth in platinum is 16 nm as measured in the resulting isolated
trenches (500 nm apart). This value will be used as a reference in the next
sections.</p>

<h4>2. 2. Topography
Results</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Figure 2 shows the results of the AFM
measurements on the fabricated arrays with periods of 65 nm (a), 50 nm (b), 35 nm
(c), and 25 nm (d). All the trenches in the arrays have been etched with the
same dose of 10 nC/cm.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">For the array with period of 65 nm, the
measured depth of the trenches is 16 nm, just the same as in the case of
isolated trenches, and it is also observed that the surface between the
trenches is still flat. However, for the array having a period of 50 nm, the
depth is reduced to 11 nm, and the surface between the trenches appears
rounded. These differences are more pronounced when the period is 35 nm where
the depth of the trenches is 5 nm, and even more pronounced when the period is
25 nm with a depth of only 2.4 nm. Because the desired depth of the trenches in
the arrays is 16 nm, we can conclude that the resolution in terms of minimum
period of this particular FIB system is about 60 nm at a current level of 1 pA when the etched surface is 16 nm.</p>

Horizontal  scale  (in nm/division) is 50 (a), 50 (b), 20 (c), 10 (d).  The depth of the trenches (in nm) is 16 (a),  11.5 (b), 5.0 (c), 2.4 (d).</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">On the other hand, figure 3 shows the image
obtained by sweeping the ion beam across a knife edge. To get this figure, the
1 pA ion beam is swept in steps of 1 nm across a
platinum nano-particle close to the working areas
where the arrays are going to be patterned. The secondary electron current
intensity produced by the sweeping is registered at every position of the ion
beam. The 15%-85% points on the integrated current profile shown in figure 3
indicate that the beam diameter is about 15 nm. Therefore it would be expected
that the width of the trenches should be about 15 nm and width a minimum period
a bit longer than that value. However the actual resolution in terms of minimum
period is about 60 nm as it can be deduced from the depth measurement of the
trenches in the array of period 65 nm which value is 16 nm. In the next section
we are going to analyze the reason for this decrease
in the depth of the trenches as the period of the arrays is reduced, and also
how it is possible to obtain the ion beam profile from the data shown in figure
2.</p>

profile. Horizontal black lines correspond to 15% and 85% points of the
maximum current. Vertical black lines correspond to the position of the ion
beam at those two points. The distance between these two positions is about 15
nm.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<h2>3. Analysis about the Reduction in Depths of the Arrays</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">When the period of the array of trenches is
larger than the ion beam diameter (D), each trench is etched as if it was
isolated from the rest of the trenches, and the original platinum surface is
still between the trenches as shown in figure 2a. However when the period is
smaller than the ion beam diameter, the beams overlap each other at the etch
positions as shown in figure 4. The platinum at the centre of the overlapping
areas is also etched at a rate that depends on the electrical current density
at that point, resulting in a reduction (H) in the depth respect to the
original platinum surface and therefore the depth of the trenches in the array
is (16-H) nm, or in other words, H=16-depth.</p>

<figure>
<img src="007_files/image019.png" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 4.Scheme showing the ion beam positions when the
period T is smaller than its diameter D. Note the overlapping

areas and the effects on the etching. </figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">We have fabricated arrays with different
periods (T) and we have measured by AFM the value of the depths as previously
shown in figure 2, thus getting the H values for every period. Note that H
corresponds to the platinum that is etched at the centre of the overlapping
region which is located at a distance R from the centre of the ion beam, being
R equals to half of the period T. The different values of H with the period T
of the array are given in Table 1.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">If we normalized the ion beam current density
at its centre (J=1), thus resulting in an etch depth of 16 nm, the current density
at a distance R=T/2 from the centre is given by J(T/2)=H/(16x2)=H/32, taken
into account here that the platinum is etched twice in the overlapping area (by
the beam at any position and at the position immediately to its right)   and that the depth is directly proportional
to the beam current given that any redeposition of
the etched platinum into the trench is observed (see figure 1a). So for
instance, according to the array with period T=50 nm (figure 2b), the depth of
the trenches is 11.5 nm, thus resulting in R=25 nm, H=4.5 nm, and J=0.14, and
also according to the array with period T=25 nm (figure 2d), the depth of the
trenches is 2.4 nm, thus resulting in R=12.5 nm, H=13.6 nm, and J=0.425. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In this
figure, for the normalized ion beam density at R=5.0 nm, and R = 7.5 nm we have
used an approximation that consists on the following. Due to the small
roughness of the initial platinum layer and the small value of the depth of
trenches of the arrays with period T= 10 nm and 15 nm, we were not completely
sure about the error of the measurements of the depth of the trenches.
Therefore, for the data at R=7.5 nm we have used the extrapolation of the ion
beam current density data for R longer than 20 nm. For R=5 nm we have taken
into account the information extracted from the figure 3.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> We can note that the beam is composed of two
parts, the core and the tail regions which are clearly different. The core part
extends to about 7.5 nm from the beam centre (thus resulting in a main diameter
of about 15 nm), while the tail region extends from the edge of the core to
approximately 25 nm beyond (thus resulting in a beam diameter of about 60 nm).
The core part of the beam carries most of the ion current and it seems that it takes the information of the beam
size measured by the sweeping across a knife edge method (see figure 3). Due to
the low value of the ion beam current used here (1 pA),
the information carried within the tail region of the ion beam is discarded
from the region outside the 15%-85% points region. However it has been shown
that the tail region is responsible for widening the top part of the trenches
as shown in figure 2b, thus avoiding the closer placement of trenches and
resulting a minimum period of about 60 nm as shown in figure 2a in our arrays.</p>

<h2>4. Conclusion</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">An experimental method is proposed to measure
the exact size of the ion beam produced by a liquid metal Ga
ion source in Focused Ion Beam systems. This method involves the fabrication of
arrays of trenches having different periods, followed by Atomic Force
Microscope measurements and further uncomplicated calculations. This method
gives the ion beam profile in terms of beam current density at any distance
from the centre of the beam and with a resolution of a few nanometres. The
method proposed in this paper shows that the beam size measured by the
classical sweeping across a knife edge method is several times smaller than the
exact size and therefore it is not directly related with the real resolution
interns of the minimum possible period of the fabrication system, especially
when dealing with low ion beam current levels suitable for nanotechnology. At
an ion beam current of 1 pA, the tail region widens
the beam to 30 nm from its centre, imposing limits to the resolution in terms
of minimum period that is expected taking into account only the core part of
the ion beam.</p>
