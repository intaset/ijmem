      <h2>Aims and Scopes</h2>
      <p class="body">Avestia Publishing has initiated the publication of the International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics (IJMEM).</p>

      <p class="body">This journal is based on the continuous model in English and adopts the open-access model, meaning all interested audience have free access to the journal's homepage and articles with no need for subscription. This ensures larger audience and therefore higher citations.</p>

      <p class="body">Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of the articles in this journal without asking prior permission from the publisher or the author. This is in accordance with the BOAI definition of open access.</p>

      <p class="body">All published papers of IJMEM are currently indexed in Google Scholar, Index Copernicus International, Academic Index, Genomics JournalSeek, and Mendeley. We are in the process of submitting all published papers to Microsoft Academic Search and Open J-Gate for indexing.</p>

      <p class="body">IJMEM is a high quality peer reviewed journal and welcomes research and review papers related to:</p>
